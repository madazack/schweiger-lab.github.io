## Project Overview

Sustainable maple syrup production necessitates identification of the healthiest trees in a sugarbush that yield the highest quality sap. Sap quality is affected by environmental conditions, resource allocation strategies, and vigor. This project investigates the relationship between sap quality and foliar chemistry/microbiology and soil biotic/abiotic conditions with the goal of predict sap production potential from noninvasive foliar spectroscopy.
## Research Questions

1. Link growing-season carbon dynamics of sugar maples, foliar chemistry & microbiology, and soil biotic and abiotic conditions to tree health & sap quality in the following year(s)

2. Develop models to predict sap quality based on non-invasive foliar spectroscopy

3. Apply spectroscopic models at the UAS scale to produce sap production potential maps across maple stands at Michigan State University's Forestry Innovation Center

4. Evaluate map products and collaborate with landowners and producers to develop protocols for early prediction of sap production potential 


## Expected Outcomes

Promote natural resource sustainability in the Maple syrup industry

Expand Maple research and development

Increase number of new Maple producers and expand capacity for existing producers

Increased consumption and consumer purchasing of Maple syrup and sap products

Develop new market opportunities for Maple producers and processors
